        <h2>LET ME TELL TOU ABOUT SOME OF MY INTERESTS</h2>
        <p>Obviously, I have a great interest in software. It tickles me to know what goes on behind the hood of a simple web application. That is the reason for me enrolling for this course in Moringa School. Ilook forward to becoming a fully stacked software engineer.</p>
        <p>It quite interests me how software is taking over almost everything. To some, this is a bad thing, but to me, it is quite intrigueing. And I want to be omong those great software engineers who will build strong software in the future; 'SO THAT WE CAN CONTROL THE WORLD....HAHAHA' </p>
        <p>Apart from software, am also a fun of nature and tourism. I love traveling during the weekend. And by the way, I have no criteria for deciding where I will be visiting. I am one of those people who just wake up and decide to go anywhere. I love watching nature. Like the waves roll on.</p>
        <p>Also, just like any other boy, I have that thing that we have with football. Like nothing can stop me from watching a football match. Oh I almost forget to mention, I am a Manchester united fan.</p>
